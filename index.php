  <p>The ship is three dimensional and you can walk around and look out the windows.  You can open doors and walk up stairs.  It's very cool.<p>

  <p>You control the ship through consoles that are built on the ship.  This is the Engineering Console.  It lets you change the structure of the ship by building new rooms, walls, and doors.  This will be your main method of improving the ship.</p>
