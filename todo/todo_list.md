# Todo List

- Clicking on things should bring up an info card
  - &#10004; Distinguish between clicking on cells and clicking on walls
  - &#10004; Highlight the thing that was clicked on
  - &#10004; Clear highlights on new click
  - &#10004; Give the name of what is highlighted
  - &#10004; Reposition card to mouse
  - &#10004; Option to deconstruct structures
  - Displays contents of crates
  - &#10004; Displays progress of planned construction and deconstruction jobs
  - Option to cancel planned construction
- Construction
  - &#10004; Knowing where to build things
     - &#10004; Not where there is already a thing
     - &#10004; Furniture must be built on floors
  - &#10004; Building hatches and doors
  - &#10004; Building furniture
  - &#10004; Building should consumer materials which must be brought to the site by crew
     - &#10004; Materials are claimed by the job at the time the structure is planned
     - &#10004; If materials are not available, the structure is not planned
  - Deconstruct structures
     - Cancel construction jobs that are in progress
     - &#10004; Spawn materials that were used to create the structure
     - Deconstruction job is saved
     - Crates and structures with contents spawn all contents when deconstructed
- Saving
  - &#10004; Jobs should be saved
  - &#10004; A button to force a save
  - An indication that saving is happening
- Robot charging pad
  - Robot runs out of charge
  - Robot returns to pad when low on energy
  - Will the robot be stuck forever if it doesn't charge in time?
- Trading
  - Ship has a certain amount of money
  - Show which items are for sale and their prices
  - Deliver purchased items to ship by shuttle
  - Delivered items must be stored by crew
  - Sold items need to be picked up
  - Crew must take sold items to shuttle
  - How the heck do shuttles work?
- Production server
- Keep the ship connected.  Structure building, planning, and deconstruction need to keep the ship in one piece at all times.
- Atmosphere
  - Pressure and composition, maybe saved as attributes on the graph
  - Spreading throughout a chamber.
     - Pressure should equalize almost immediately,
     - Composition should take a little longer to propagate
  - Escaping into space
  - Maintained by machine(s)
     - Unwanted gasses must be removed (carbon dioxide, ammonia, acetone)
     - Keep all necessary gasses at correct levels
     - Decide whether to have a lot of filters and tanks, or just one machine
     that monitors everything
     - There needs to be some sort of ventilation management system.  Should air just go through doors?  Does every room need an atmosphere monitoring machine?  Are there vents?
  - Leaks through open doors
     - Enough atmosphere should escape through a door while a crew member is passing through to empty a room
  - If atmosphere can't move through closed doors normally, then we need some other kind of ventilation
  - Rooms and groups of rooms are hydrostatically connected nodes that should have the same air pressure, composition, and temperature
- Temperature should conduct through walls.
- Airlocks.  How do they work? Are they a special piece of furniture, or are they a collection of walls and doors that somehow function as an airlock?
  - Since pathfinding will ignore locked doors, how does a crew member decide to use an airlock?
- Fluid storage, tanks of liquids and gasses
  - Oxygen and nitrogen for atmosphere management
  - Water for everything
  - Fuel and oxygen for propellant and power generation
  - All those same substances and more as cargo to sell at the next port. Maybe even dangerous chemicals like acids or explosives
- Power generation and consumption.
- Time management
  - Pause time
  - Let time advance at different speeds
- Find a way to draw lower levels.  I'd like to make them darker.
- &#10004; Some scheme for marking items done on this list
- &#10004; Open/Close animations for doors and hatches
  - &#10004; Hatches spin open like a mechanical iris
     - &#10004; Create new vector art for hatches, replace sprite
  - &#10004; Doors open for crew, crew do not open doors.  The crew doesn't need to check if the door is open, only if it is unlocked
  - &#10004; Invent doors (create art for doors)
     - &#10004; Doors should have the same profile as walls
     - &#10004; Doors slide open like grocery store doors
- &#10004; User accounts
  - &#10004; Saving the game
  - &#10004; Login page
  - &#10004; Account creation
    - &#10004; New accounts get default ship
    - &#10004; Reasonable error messages
  - &#10004; Source control for server side code
- &#10004; Interface
  - &#10004; Heads Up Display
    - &#10004; Level indicator top, center, and big
    - &#10004; Top and bottom bars for buttons
  - &#10004; Card system
    - &#10004; Cards pop up and disappear
    - &#10004; Cards can be pinned
    - &#10004; Cards can be moved
    - &#10004; Cards are pinned when they are moved
    - &#10004; Cards disappear when unfocused, unless they are pinned
    - &#10004; Pinned cards move to top of other cards when focused
    - &#10004; Active cards should be kept on screen after a resize
  - &#10004; Make it more obvious which wall you're interacting with, perhaps by highlighting the one you select or are hovering over
  - &#10004; Instructions for basic controls
- &#10004; Loose items are scooped up my crew and stored in crates
- &#10004; Click and drag to pan
