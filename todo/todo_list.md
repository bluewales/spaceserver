# Todo

 - Crew
   - There is a 3D model for a crew member
   - Crew exist and can move around
   - Crew don't move through walls
   - Crew can path to a desired location
   - Crew take jobs off the job list and do them
   - There are robotic crew members
   - There are organic crew members
   - Crew members can be hired or dismissed at port or when trading with another ship
 - Jobs
   - There should be a job list
   - Jobs keep track of which resources are required to complete and don't let other jobs claim those same resources
   - Jobs detect if required resources become unavailable
   - Jobs are saved and loaded
 - Items
   - Solid objects can be loose on the ship, lying on the floor
   - Items can be in containers
 - Engineering Console
   - ✓ Create rooms by dragging
   - Distinguish between actual structure and planned structure
   - Indicate when a structure has been marked for deconstruction
   - Create construction/deconstruction jobs based on changes made in console
   - Clicking on things should bring up info in the side panel
     - Highlight the thing that was clicked on
     - Clear highlights on new click
     - Give the name of what is highlighted
     - Displays progress of planned construction and deconstruction jobs pertaining to that structure
     - Option to cancel planned construction
   - Show which spaces must be clear for stairs to be placed
   - Create better 3D model for console.
 - Construction
   - ✓ Building doors and windows
   - Don't allow illegal build commands
     - ✓ Walls, windows, and doors can only be built next to floors
     - Not where there is already a thing
     - Furniture must be built on floors and not open space
     - Walls or floors cannot be build to block stairs
     - Furniture cannot block a door or a stair landing
   - Build stairs
     - Stairs present a UI problem because they span two floors, but you can only see one floor at a time in the engineering console
     - Stairs can be placed either from the bottom, or the top
     - When stairs are placed, they automatically alter the structure around them
       - Stairs create walls to either side on both levels
       - Stairs clear any walls inside themselves or blocking their entrances
   - Building furniture like consoles and machines
     - Building engineering consoles
     - Building storage crates
     - Building other machines like power generators or water purifiers
     - Only one furniture per cell
     - Furniture might be larger than a single cell
     - Stairs count as furniture for purposes of occupying cells
   - Building should consume materials which must be brought to the site by crew
     - Materials are claimed by the job at the time the structure is planned
     - If materials are not available, the structure is not planned
   - Deconstruct structures
     - Spawn materials that were used to create the structure
     - Deconstruction job is saved
     - Structures with contents (crates) spawn all contents when deconstructed
   - Cancel construction jobs that are in progress
   - Construction bot
     - Engineering console creates construction jobs
     - Construction bots on the ship run around and fulfill construction jobs
     - Robot charging pad
       - Robot runs out of charge
       - Robot returns to pad when low on energy
       - Will the robot be stuck forever if it doesn't charge in time?
   - Keep the ship connected.  Structure building, planning, and deconstruction need to keep the ship in one piece at all times
 - User accounts
   - Saving the game
     - Saving should happen automatically on a regular basis
     - A button to force a save in the pause menu
     - Save should happen on window close
     - Structure of ship should be saved
     - Position of character should be saved
     - Jobs should be saved
     - An indication that saving is happening
   - Login page
   - Account creation
     - New accounts get default ship
     - Reasonable error messages
   - On load dialog box works
     - *Login button*
     - *Create Account* button
     - *Continue Without Login* button
   - If you're not logged in, give options to Login/Create Account in game
     - Button in top bar that changes between Login/Logout base on current login status
 - Graphics
   - Rooms
     - Ship is divided up into rooms
     - Only the room the player is in and rooms connected to it by windows and open doors are rendered
   - Textures and normal maps for panels instead of 3D trim pieces
 - Production server
 - Time management
   - A concept of absolute time that is saved
   - Let time advance at different speeds; fast forward in console or by sleeping
 - Atmosphere
   - Rooms and groups of rooms are hydrostatically connected nodes that should have single values for air pressure, composition, and temperature
   - Atmosphere in a room is uniform.
   - When doors open, atmosphere equalized instantly between them
   - Escaping into space
   - Maintained by machine(s)
     - Unwanted gasses must be removed (eg. carbon dioxide, ammonia, acetone)
     - Keep all necessary gasses at correct levels
     - Decide whether to have a lot of filters and tanks, or just one machine that monitors everything
     - There needs to be some sort of ventilation management system.  Should air just go through doors?  Does every room need an atmosphere monitoring machine?  Are there vents?
       - There should be pipes running bellow floors and between walls to circulate air
 - Airlocks.  How do they work? Are they a special piece of furniture, or are they a collection of walls and doors that somehow function as an airlock?
   - Since pathfinding will ignore locked doors, how does a crew member decide to use an airlock?
 - Fluids
   - Storage, tanks of liquids and gasses
   - Oxygen and nitrogen for atmosphere management
   - Water for everything
   - Fuel and oxygen for propellant and power generation
   - All those same substances and more as cargo to sell at the next port. Maybe even dangerous chemicals like acids or explosives
   - Pipes, hoses, or ducts for transporting fluids around the ship behind the walls
 - Loose items are scooped up by crew and stored in crates
 - Trading
   - You can trade at planetary ports
   - You can trade with other ships you might meet in the void
   - Economy
     - The economy simulation generates prices
     - Prices can be loaded through the API
     - Player trades are submitted to the economy
     - Player trades are resolved against citizen trades eventually
   - Ship has a certain amount of money
   - Some way to tell what items are on the ship and available to sell
   - Show which items are for sale and their prices
   - How the heck do shuttles work?
     - Deliver purchased items to ship by shuttle
       - Delivered items must be stored by crew
     - Sold items need to be picked up by the shuttle
       - Crew must take sold items to shuttle
 - Travel
 - Power generation
   - Cables beneath the floor?
 - Crafting
 - Gravity
   - Items, Crew, and the Player should behave differently depending on whether the ship is under thrust or in free fall
   - Liquids should flow through pipes differently under gravity
