     - &#10004; A button to open doors 
     - &#10004; Doors close after a time
   - Windows   
     - Windows are represented in engineering console
     - Windows are represented in save data
     - Windows are transparent
   - Rooms
     - Ship is divided up into rooms
     - Only the room the player is in and rooms connected to it by window and open doors are rendered
   - Textures and normal maps for panels instead of 3D trim pieces
 - Stop walking through walls
 - User accounts
   - Saving the game
     - Saving should happen automatically on a regular basis
     - A button to force a save in the pause menu
     - Save should happen on window close
     - Structure of ship should be saved
     - Position of character should be saved
     - Jobs should be saved
     - An indication that saving is happening
   - Login page
   - Account creation
     - New accounts get default ship
     - Reasonable error messages
   - On load dialog box works
     - *Login button*
     - *Create Account* button
     - *Continue Without Login* button
   - If you're not logged in, give options to Login/Create Account in game
     - Button in top bar that changes between Login/Logout base on current login status
 - Engineering Console
   - Create rooms by dragging
   - Distinguish between actual structure and planned structure
   - Create construction jobs based on changes made in console
   - Clicking on things should bring up info in the side panel
     - Highlight the thing that was clicked on
     - Clear highlights on new click
     - Give the name of what is highlighted
     - Displays progress of planned construction and deconstruction jobs pertaining to that structure
     - Option to cancel planned construction
 - Construction
   - Don't allow illegal build commands
     - Not where there is already a thing
     - Furniture must be built on floors
   - Building doors and windows
   - Building furniture like console and stairs
   - Building should consumer materials which must be brought to the site by crew
     - Materials are claimed by the job at the time the structure is planned
     - If materials are not available, the structure is not planned
   - Deconstruct structures
     - Spawn materials that were used to create the structure
     - Deconstruction job is saved
     - Structures with contents (crates) spawn all contents when deconstructed
   - Cancel construction jobs that are in progress
   - Construction bot
     - Engineering console creates construction jobs
     - Construction bots on the ship run around and fulfill construction jobs
     - Robot charging pad
       - Robot runs out of charge
       - Robot returns to pad when low on energy
       - Will the robot be stuck forever if it doesn't charge in time?
   - Keep the ship connected.  Structure building, planning, and deconstruction need to keep the ship in one piece at all times
 - Production server
 - Time management
   - A concept of absolute time that is saved
   - Let time advance at different speeds; fast forward in console or by sleeping
 - Atmosphere
   - Rooms and groups of rooms are hydrostatically connected nodes that should have single values for air pressure, composition, and temperature
   - Atmosphere in a room is uniform.
   - When doors open, atmosphere equalized instantly between them
   - Escaping into space
   - Maintained by machine(s)
     - Unwanted gasses must be removed (carbon dioxide, ammonia, acetone)
     - Keep all necessary gasses at correct levels
     - Decide whether to have a lot of filters and tanks, or just one machine that monitors everything
     - There needs to be some sort of ventilation management system.  Should air just go through doors?  Does every room need an atmosphere monitoring machine?  Are there vents?
       - There should be pipes running bellow floors and between walls to circulate air
 - Airlocks.  How do they work? Are they a special piece of furniture, or are they a collection of walls and doors that somehow function as an airlock?
   - Since pathfinding will ignore locked doors, how does a crew member decide to use an airlock?
 - Fluid storage, tanks of liquids and gasses
   - Oxygen and nitrogen for atmosphere management
   - Water for everything
   - Fuel and oxygen for propellant and power generation
   - All those same substances and more as cargo to sell at the next port. Maybe even dangerous chemicals like acids or explosives
 - Loose items are scooped up by crew and stored in crates
 - Trading
   - Economy
     - The economy simulation generates prices
     - Prices can be loaded through the API
     - Player trades are submitted to the economy
     - Player trades are resolved against citizen trades eventually
   - Ship has a certain amount of money
   - Some way to tell what items are on the ship and available to sell
   - Show which items are for sale and their prices
   - How the heck do shuttles work?
     - Deliver purchased items to ship by shuttle
       - Delivered items must be stored by crew
     - Sold items need to be picked up by the shuttle
       - Crew must take sold items to shuttle
 - Power generation
 - Crafting
 - Travel
