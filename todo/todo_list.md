# Todo List

- User accounts
  - &#10004; Saving the game
  - &#10004; Login page
  - &#10004; Account creation
     - &#10004; New accounts get default ship
     - &#10004; Reasonable error messages
  - Source control for server side code
- Interface
  - Make it more obvious which wall you're interacting with, perhaps by highlighting the one you select or are hovering over
  - Can deconstruction be more intuitive?
  - It takes so much clicking!
  - Add menu for viewing crew
  - Address memory leak in menus
  - Heads Up Display
  - Instructions for basic controls
- Construction
  - Knowing where to build walls
  - Building hatches and doors
  - Disallowing deconstruction that would disconnect the ship
  - Build floors above or bellow floors as well as beside floors
  - Building furniture
  - Building should consumer materials which must be brought to the site by crew
- Robot charging pad
  - Robot runs out of charge
  - Robot returns to pad when low on energy
  - Will the robot be stuck forever if it doesn't charge in time?
- Trading
  - Ship has a certain amount of money
  - Show which items are for sale and their prices
  - Deliver purchased items to ship by shuttle
  - Delivered items must be stored by crew
  - Sold items need to be picked up
  - Crew must take sold items to shuttle
  - How the heck do shuttles work?
- Production server
- Atmosphere
  - Pressure and composition, maybe saved as attributes on the graph
  - Spreading throughout a chamber.
     - Pressure should equalize almost immediately,
     - Composition should take a little longer to propagate
  - Escaping into space
  - Maintained by machine(s)
     - Unwanted gasses must be removed (carbon dioxide, ammonia, acetone)
     - Keep all necessary gasses at correct levels
     - Decide whether to have a lot of filters and tanks, or just one machine
     that monitors everything
     - There needs to be some sort of ventilation management system.  Should air just go through doors?  Does every room need an atmosphere monitoring machine?  Are there vents?
  - Leaks through open doors
     - Enough atmosphere should escape through a door while a crew member is passing through to empty a room
  - If atmosphere can't move through closed doors normally, then we need some other kind of ventilation
  - Rooms and groups of rooms are hydrostatically connected nodes that should have the same air pressure, composition, and temperature
- Temperature should conduct through walls.
- Airlocks.  How do they work? Are they a special piece of furniture, or are they a collection of walls and doors that somehow function as an airlock?
  - Since pathfinding will ignore locked doors, how does a crew member decide to use an airlock?  At least one of the doors should be locked all the time.
- Fluid storage, tanks of liquids and gasses
  - Oxygen and nitrogen for atmosphere management
  - Water for everything
  - Fuel and oxygen for propellant and power generation
  - All those same substances and more as cargo to sell at the next port. Maybe even dangerous chemicals like acids or explosives
- Find a way to draw lower levels.  I'd like to make them darker.
- &#10004; Some scheme for marking items done on this list
- &#10004; Open/Close animations for doors and hatches
  - &#10004; Hatches spin open like a mechanical iris
     - &#10004; Create new vector art for hatches, replace sprite
  - &#10004; Doors open for crew, crew do not open doors.  The crew doesn't need to check if the door is open, only if it is unlocked
  - &#10004; Invent doors (create art for doors)
     - &#10004; Doors should have the same profile as walls
     - &#10004; Doors slide open like grocery store doors
