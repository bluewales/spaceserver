## My Own Watch Function

Most of my display objects also contain all their own state.  So far that has worked great.  The robot object contains all the information about its own state, and it relies on no other objects for its display.

Menus are different.  Menus show lots of data about the game state, but they contain none of the game state.  I found myself wanting a 'bind' functionality like you might find in a proper framework.  JavaScript had a `watch` function for a while, but it's ben deprecated and removed.  So, I made my own.

```javascript
Object.defineProperty(Object.prototype, "watch", {
  enumerable: false,
  configurable: true,
  writable: false,
  value: function (property, callback) {
    var descriptor = {};
    if(property in this) {
      descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(this, property);
    }
    var old_set = descriptor.set;
    var old_get = descriptor.get;
    var old_value = this[property];

    delete descriptor.writable;
    delete descriptor.value;

    var property_alias = "_watched_" + property;

    descriptor.set = function (value) {
      this[property_alias] = value;
      if (old_set) old_set(value);
      callback(value);
    };

    if (old_get) {
      descriptor.get = old_get;
    } else {
      descriptor.get = function () {
        return this[property_alias];
      }
    }

    Object.defineProperty(this, property, descriptor);

    this[property] = old_value;
  }
});
```

This has a few features which I needed.  It maintains the old value.  It maintains any existing getter/setter functionality.  It allows for multiple watchers.

It turns out this is a common problem.  There are many libraries that will solve it for you.  Most of them have an `unwatch` function, which I do not have.
