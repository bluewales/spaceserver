## More Useful Cards

Trading is going to be a menu heavy feature. You'll select your purchases in a menu, monitor their progress in a menu, and watch prices in a menu.  My current card system is not good enough for all the things the trading menus will need.  This is the sort of thing that would be much easier to do in HTML.  Arranging words, text fields, buttons, and other display elements is what HTML is all about.  I'm finding myself in the awkward position of reproducing some of that capability from scratch.

The first things I'm going to want are numerical selector that lets you type in a number or increment/decrement by clicking, tabs, pictures, and columns.
