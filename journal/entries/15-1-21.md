## Construction

I've been thinking about construction.  Specifically about how to
represent incomplete structures on the ship.  Visually, I could draw planned,
but unbuilt structures with some transparency so they look ghostly.  That
will probably work.  Logically, though I'm not sure.  I've decided to try
giving structures a property that represents how complete they are.  Then I
will just create the object as soon as it's planned and increase its
completeness as it's worked on.  I like this better than having a "ghost"
version of every structure piece.
