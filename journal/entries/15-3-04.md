## Construction is Working

I started on this game just under one earth year ago.  (I know it sounds *so* stupid to say "earth year", but I've been labeling these post with a made up calendar and that means I have to specify which year I'm talking about)  I just barely got construction working.  It's the first major feature.  At this rate, the James Web Space Telescope is going to launch before the game is worth playing.  

I'm going to take a diversion to implement the minor feature of robot charging.  It will be the first crew "need", and will be a prototype for biological needs like food and sleep.

The next major feature will be trading.  It will require a couple new menus, a landing platform for a shuttle, a working delivery shuttle, and probably a few new item types including money. With trading, it will finally be a game.  There will progression as you will be able to gain wealth and materials to make the ship bigger.  There will be decisions to make as some trade options will be better than others.  It will be a simple and pointless game at that point, but I still consider it an important milestone.

From there, the next thing will be to make the ship more like a space ship.  Things like pressurized compartments, airlocks, interplanetary navigation, and perhaps most importantly, biological crew.
