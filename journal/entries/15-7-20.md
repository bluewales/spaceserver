## Doors

The day is the morrow, and I've come to a conclusion regarding my previous issue.  I have decided to start on doors.  I need doors anyways, but the thing doors give me is the ability to separate rooms.  I think a strong concept of rooms will make the engineering console easier.  Doors will have two halves, each of the two cubes linked by a door will include their own half of a door.
