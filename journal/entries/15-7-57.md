## Sliding Doors

I'm proud to report that the doors now slide.  Open and close and everything.  My previous entry called out the two halves of doors as if it was an amazing innovation which would make my life easier.  It was a fact a pain in the neck that I was forced into based on some of my previous organizational decisions.  I think they turned out pretty cool.  The open buttons beside the door don't look like much, but the art debt grows and grows.  I wanted it to be little control panels, but I don't think I can make that look good.  I really want to work with an artist.
