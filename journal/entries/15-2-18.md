## Release Date

To motivate myself and to measure my progress, I have decided on a release date.  It's a completely arbitrary date.  The game wont be done, but it is supposed to be in a playable state.  It'll be something I can tell people about and try to get them to play it. It'll have a dedicated production server so the stable game will always be available.  The dev server will still be live, but when I break it I can still point people towards the production server.  I'm planning a reduced feature set.  There will only be two of the main systems at work, trading and construction.  I feel like that will be enough to make it a game instead of an animation.  From that point I can start adding some of the other main features I have in mind, like travel and crafting.  Also, I will have to start trying to make it fun.  The planned release date is 15-2-61.  Because of course I'm making plans in space time.
