## User Interface of Cards

What if the user interface revolved around menus that pop up in little windows, more like cards?  It's what Banished does.  Everything you can click on and interact with brings up a card.  The cards can't be resized, but they can be moved around.  Cards closed when any click happens outside of them, unless they've been pinned, then you have to click the X.  Moving a card pins it.  Since they aren't windows, they don't have frames.  The title is in the body, so is the X.  The border is just there to make the edge stand out.
