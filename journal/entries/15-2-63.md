## Missed the Release Date

You may have noticed that the release date has come and passed.  I did indeed miss the release date.  I have done almost no work on this project since I set the date.  I have been spending more time working on a machine learning project.  It's been fun, but it's not as good for showing to people.  One of these days I'll take the project back out again.
