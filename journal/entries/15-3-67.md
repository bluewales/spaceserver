## The Vestian Calendar

One space year is about 1157 Earth days.  If something had a circular orbit around the sun, it's orbit would be in the asteroid belt.  Naturally, I wanted to find out which asteroid had a year exactly equal to a space year.  Of the 50 largest asteroids, I was disappointed to find that all of them orbit the sun too slowly.  The major asteroid with the orbit closest to a space year turned out to be one of the most major asteroid, Vesta.  Based on that, I want to call my space calendar the Vestian Calendar.  That would make one of my vestian year 15% shorter than a year on Vesta, which you would also want to call a vestian year.  This is extremely confusing.  Still I'd rather talk about how vestian days than space days.
