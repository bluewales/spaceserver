## Using Computers in a Computer Game

In 2D management games like Oxygen Not Included, interacting with things is very straightforward.  You click on things and a little box opens up the corner.  If you can see it, you can click on it.  In 3D games like Satisfactory, you've got to run up to something to click on it.  It's also very straightforward.  The smelter has to look like it's within arm's reach for you to take stuff out of it.  I'm thinking of going a different way, with a little less straightforwardness.

Here's the plan.  There will be very little that you can interact with in person as you run around the ship.  You can press buttons and open doors, but the big stuff like building rooms, setting crew schedules, moving the ship, and trading will all be done from consoles.  You'll use the engineering console to plan construction projects like adding new rooms and moving equipment.  Then, you'll leave the console and wander around the ship watching your crew carry out your orders.  You can log into the HR console to check on the status of your crew members and manage their responsibilities.  You'll use the navigation console to see your position in space and plot a course to your next destination.  So the game will consist of running around and using the different consoles.
