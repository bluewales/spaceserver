## Cards Aren't Working

It turns out I need to refactor cards.  I feel like I spend more time refactoring thing's I've written than writing.  At least I'm not debugging.

Cards were designed to be tightly coupled with buttons. When you click a button the card pops up and the button is highlighted.  When you click the button again, the card is closed and the button goes back to normal.  When you close the card, the button needs to return to normal.  This seemed like a straight forward interaction that was going to be pretty common.  All buttons had a card and all cards had a button.  That seems like a mistake now.

I ran into problems a while ago when I needed buttons that do things other than bring up cards.  Some buttons perform a single action, and others put us into build mode.   To deal that, I made buttons flexible, they could have cards, or they could have callbacks.  By default, buttons toggle when pressed, unless the callback resets them.

Now, I'm trying to create cards that aren't tied to buttons.  They pop up when you click on a part of the ship.  It doesn't seem reasonable for the ship to be a button.

I need to properly decouple cards and buttons.  I'm not sure how I'm going to handle all that.  UI is hard.
