## Card Nests

I'm liking my decision to make a card-based UI system.  It's not too surprising it's working well since it's similar to application windows in operating systems.  I have successfully expanded the system to support tabbed cards and columnated cards.  Both use frameless cards as sub cards.  My first use of it is in a "Market" card.  It has tabs that can be selected one at a time.  Each tab is a columnated card with multiple columns.  Each column is one of my "interaction" cards which have rows of basic UI elements such as text, buttons, etc.  I might have cause to allow a row of an interaction card be another card.  Nesting cards is fun.
