When I started this journal I had an idea that it would be a way to get people interested in this game and to share the development experience.  I know that I really enjoy reading about the development of games that I play.  Unfortunately, I don't think it's going to serve that purpose.  It's not just that no one reads it, it's more that it's not very good.  This poorly written, un-edited, rambling train of thought style is not very useful for communicating technical ideas.  I'm afraid I veer back and forth between boring and confusing.  I'm not going to fix it.  It would take too much time to do it right.  I'm not a talented writer.  It's a good thing that these journals serve another purpose.  They aid development by giving me a framework for thinking about problems I'm having.  And to a lesser extent, giving me a place to record ideas I have that I don't have time to implement.  So, I'm going to keep writing.
