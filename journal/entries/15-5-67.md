## The Linux Shuttle

My computer died.  There was a power outage and the server that I've been hosting off of never turned back on.  I recovered the system by plugging the hard drive into a completely different motherboard.  Surprisingly, it booted up just fine.  I must say, going from a Pentium 4 to an i5 is a big jump.  Either way, I pretty much only booted it up to get some data off of it.  If the motherboard was old enough to die, then the hard drive probably wasn't far behind.

My new server is running Fedora instead of CentOS, and since it was installed with a desktop environment I'm now developing on it directly instead of through remote access.  I'd kind of like to transition to using Linux as my primary home computer for a while.

I've also got art for the shuttle's landing pad.  It has giant 'H' on it.  I don't like that.  The shuttle is not a helicopter.  There was nothing else I could think of that would communicate "landing pad".  I'll have to live with it till I come up with something better.
