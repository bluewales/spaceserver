## Items

First, is it clear that these entries are more of a brainstorming/design journal than a development diary?  I bet it's clear by now.

The game need to have items.  These are different from other entities in the game in several ways.  Most prominently, items don't always have proper locations.  Crew and structures always have an integer position on the grid, and items can have that too if they are just set on the ground, but items can also be carried by crew or be inside furniture.  So, perhaps they are represented as properties of those entities.  Crew can only hold one item at a time, and that item is drawn on top of the crew icon.  Furniture, such as crates, have an inventory which can contain a certain number of items.  In the raw file, items will be saved to the ship if they are left sitting around, or inside the crew or furniture item if that's where they are.
