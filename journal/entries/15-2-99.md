## VS Code

I'm giving Visual Studio Code a second shot.  I got ftp-sync to work for me, though I'm still having some trouble with it.  

These are my complaints:

- There's no easy way to delete a file on the server, you delete the file locally then sync local-to-remote.  There's no feedback that you've actually done it, you have to check the server
- When errors occure, a little pop up appears in the bottom. It has no useful information has to be clicked on to go away
- The output window prints some things, but not useful information.  I'd like to see which files are synced, in which direction, and wether the sync was successful.
- If an error ever occurs (which is inevitable because file transfers of the internet fail somtimes), a notice of the failure shows up at the bottom of the program and stays there.  It's just annoying.

There's a few more FTP extensions.  Is it worth my time to evaluate those?  After all, ftp-sync is working.
