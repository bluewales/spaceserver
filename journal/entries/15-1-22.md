## Implementing  Construction

Construction is implemented!  This is exciting.  Now the little constructor bot
will move to the site, bob there for a while, and then the structure will turn
solid.  There is no constructing animation, I imagined some sort of welding
sparks, but there is no such thing.  There are some weird bugs where new
construction jobs are being ignored after some point.  I guess fixing that is
next.
