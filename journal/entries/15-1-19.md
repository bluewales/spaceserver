## VASIMR

Today, I learned about the
[VASIMR engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_Specific_Impulse_Magnetoplasma_Rocket).
It is similar to an ion engine
in that it uses electric energy to accelerate a monopropellant.  The
difference is that the VASIMR engine works much better at larger thrust.  It
also seems that VASIMR works better with any available gas, while ion
engines only work well with heavy elements such as xenon.

I'm still thinking that the play will begin with a chemical rocket, but I'd
like to later give them the option to upgrade to a VASIMR engine.  The
VASIMR could use any liquid or gas as propellant, while chemical engines need
an oxidizer and a fuel. (which are modifiers I imagine chemicals will have
when I get that far)  The VASIMR engine consumes a lot of electrical energy,
possibly requiring a nuclear reactor.  This might be a way of unlocking
continuous thrust transfers which will be faster and will also provide an
artificial gravity aboard the spacecraft.
