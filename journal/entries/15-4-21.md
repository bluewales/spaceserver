## I Have Solved Word Hunger

It my simulation at least.  The vicious cycles of instability caused by food has been mitigated.  Turns out the solution was food storage.  I just had to tweak the AI of my citizens so that they would prefer to keep a large stockpile of food (half a dozen days worth).  Now when they start to run out and try to buy more, the market has a few cycles to react before the citizens loose productivity.

I should be able to start integrating the economy into the game now.  The API is up and running for loading prices of goods, and I added a few goods to the simulation that I want the game to have access to.  I'm hoping to get back to more frequent contributions and updates.  We'll see.
