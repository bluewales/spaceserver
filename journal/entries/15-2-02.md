## Deliveries and Pick Ups

When the player trades for materials and items, how do they get on and off the ship?  I guess the player is actually trading with some sort of orbital warehouse.  It probably makes the most sense for the player to dock with the warehouse, but I don't think that's going to happen.  It's the most complex to animate, and it doesn't allow the player to make a stationary space station.  It's got to be shuttles that come to the player's ship.  The most Dwarf Fortress style thing to do would be to make the player build a docking bay which only works if it meets some basic requirements.  It will have to be large enough and exposed to outer space, probably with an unobstructed straight path to outer space.
