## User Interface

I never know how to handle the user interface.  In my last attempt, I was very proud of my car system, but I don't think it works this time.  I don't want movable windows hovering over the 3D world; I want all the UI elements to be in consoles the user has to click on.  I want to go for a bit of a modem-punk vibe, with static, blocky UI elements on the side of the screen.  Also, I think it's silly to code my own UI elements when I'm working the the browser.  HTML is made for this sort of thing.  Sort of.

My first UI is going to be the engineering console.  It will be a place to view the map of the ship, and view and edit the structure.  For now, I'm going to give it panning across the blueprint in all four directions, maybe zoom in and out, go up and down levels, and quit.  Panning will be ADSW, the same as moving in the 3D world, but also dragging with the mouse.  Zoom will be the mouse wheel.  Going up and down levels will be the up and down arrows.  I don't know what form the build/destroy option will take, but I've decided to not worry about it for now.  I just need to implement these basic controls and put indicators on the screen somewhere.  I'm thinking either along the bottom, or in the side panel at the top.
