## I Guess I'm Starting Over

I really want the game to be a three dimensional world.  I was trying to do it like Dwarf Fortress with z-levels that you can step up and down through, seeing one level at a time.  I was thinking, if it's good enough for dwarf fortress then it's good enough for me.  Now I'm thinking that dwarf fortress is not a shining example of usability.  Dwarf fortress made graphical decisions based on what could be rendered in a console.  Which is just text.  I have multiple options for 3D engines, even if I want it to be a web based game.

So, it is my pleasure to introduce, the new 3D Safiina!  It's live!  You can play it now.  It's a huge step back, feature wise.  There's no robot, no items, no storage, and no construction.  You can run around and fall off the ship though.

Everything takes so much longer in 3D.
