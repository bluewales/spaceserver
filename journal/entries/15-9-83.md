## New Walls

The 15th year of the epoch comes to a close in less than two weeks.  Isn't that something.

I got walls, windows, and doors working.  Now you can use the engineering console to place them and they will appear in the 3D space.  It's kinda nifty, but they aren't just supposed to appear immediately.  Someone is supposed to build them.  I suppose I need to implement crew.  I need a single robotic crew member to run around the ship.  Once it exists, I can make it the construction bot and make it fulfil build orders created on the engineering console.
