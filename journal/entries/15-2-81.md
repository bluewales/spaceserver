## Visual Studio Code

I tried out *Visual Studio Code* today.  I somehow got the idea that it was the next new shiny text editor.  It's another editor along the lines of *Sublime*.  It does seem like it has some neat features. I especially like that the explorer bar has separate sessions for file system and opened files.  Unfortunately, it has a single, fatal flaw:  VS Code sucks at FTP.  There are a whole host of FTP extensions, but none of them are great.  The first one, "ftp-kr" is hard to use if you're not fluent in Korean.  The second one, "ftp-simple" is the only one I actually got to work, but I couldn't stand it.  In order to actually see the files in the explorer bar, you have to download the remote directory, but the remote directory has thousands of files in it.  Most of them are images.  It would be great if I could configure the extension to ignore all files in the "img" folder, but the include paths only seem to apply to uploading.

Anyway, I'm back to working with *Atom* using the "remote-sync" extension.  It's fine.
